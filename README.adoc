= Guix overlay for NixOS
:toc:


It's an overlay for installing Guix in NixOS.
Forked originally from link:https://github.com/Emiller88/guix[Emiller88's Guix overlay].




== What's in the flake?

Here's what the flake should contain from the most interesting to the most boring.

* `overlay` which contains the overlay for the Guix (and its dependencies) as a Nix package.
* `packages.${system}.${package}` containing derivations of Guix and the dependencies.
* `nixosModules.guix` is the primary NixOS module from link:./module/[`./module/`] exported for this project.
* `devShell.${system}` is the development shell for this project.

It primarily contains a package for Guix (built from source) and a NixOS module for easily setting up Guix in your systems.
Please see link:./flake.nix[`./flake.nix`] for more details.




== Prerequisites

You need Nix 2.4 and above to enable Nix flakes and the new command line interface.
To enable them, you need to add `experimental-features = nix-command flakes` from your Nix configuration (e.g., `/etc/nix/nix.conf`).

Now, to add it in your flake configuration...

[source, nix]
----
inputs.guix-overlay = "github:foo-dogsquared/nix-overlay-guix";
----

...and add the overlay in `nixpkgs.overlays`.

[source, nix]
----
nixpkgs.overlays = [
  # Your overlays...

  # The guix overlay.
  inputs.guix-overlay.overlay
];
----

You can add Guix as a additional package or as an additional service to your NixOS systems.

[source, nix]
----
# configuration.nix
{
  # ...the rest of your NixOS system config.

ã€€# Enabling the Guix daemon and the package manager in your system.
  services.guix.enable = true;
}
----




== Why fork it?

* First and foremost, I want to explore how to make an overlay like this.
I want the two package manager work together without much trouble (in the side of NixOS anyways).

* Try to make Guix work on a NixOS-based system.
I want it to make my Guix workflow works without resorting to virtual machines.
My workstation is just a potato ran by a hamster that is nearing its life expectancy and I cannot afford it any longer.
I WANT IT TO JUST WORK!

* Well, the original repository doesn't see much additional commits in the last year.
In that timeframe, Guix v1.3.0 has been released and more features is yet to be seen such as the Guix home configurations and additional fixes and small-scale features.
I don't want to miss out with another clunky virtual machine that is just further making my battery drain more.


=== TODO

* [ ] Cleanup the codebase.
** [ ] Cleanup the additional Guile modules.
** [ ] Format with `nixfmt`.

* [ ] Document the flake and its outputs.

* [ ] Make it compatible with the traditional `default.nix`.
** [ ] Use link:https://github.com/edolstra/flake-compat[this module].

* [x] Cache the package set of this project.

* [x] Make use of a CI system to automate building and updating.

* [x] Create packages for Guix with the binary installation.
